## Project Description

**10xCards** is a modern web application that enables automatic generation of flashcards using artificial intelligence. The goal of the project is to significantly speed up and simplify the process of creating study materials, allowing users to quickly transform any text they input (via copy-paste) into high-quality flashcards for effective learning.

With 10xCards, users can:
- üìù Paste any text content and generate flashcards automatically
- ü§ñ Leverage AI to create intelligent, well-structured study materials
- ‚ö° Save time by eliminating manual flashcard creation
- üéØ Focus on learning rather than content preparation

## Getting Started Locally

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** v22.14.0 (specified in `.nvmrc`)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

> **Tip**: We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager) to manage Node.js versions.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sobocim/10x-cards.git
cd 10x-cards
```

2. **Use the correct Node.js version:**

```bash
nvm use
```

This will automatically switch to Node.js v22.14.0 as specified in `.nvmrc`.

3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

4. **Set up environment variables:**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and add your configuration values.

5. **Start the development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000/`.

6. **Build for production:**

```bash
npm run build
```

7. **Preview the production build:**

```bash
npm run preview
```
